# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component

![Design preview for the Profile card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

**The** challenge is to build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Things to improve
- Try to work on positioning profile picture using margin-bottom rather than top properties âœ”
- Mobile display support, at the moment only support desktop design
- Update the circle backgrounf positioning to be more dynamic
**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
